# PromiseAI: Secure Document Intelligence Platform  
PromiseAI is a next-generation **document intelligence system** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **summarization models**, and **entity extraction** to automate case file reviews for public agencies. It helps analysts and clerks quickly process large volumes of documents by flagging incomplete submissions, extracting essential information, and generating concise summaries — enhancing both efficiency and service delivery.

## Overview
Public agencies often face overwhelming document loads—case files, citizen applications, legal forms, and reports—many of which are inconsistent or incomplete. PromiseAI solves this by automating document understanding through advanced NLP and machine learning. It scans, classifies, and summarizes documents while maintaining strict data security and compliance standards.

PromiseAI integrates seamlessly with existing workflows, ensuring faster processing, reduced human error, and improved transparency in government operations.

## Key Features

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** FastAPI or Node.js (Express)  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch for document indexing  
- **AI/NLP:** Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, PEGASUS, T5), spaCy, NLTK  
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption, JWT authentication, HTTPS/TLS  
- **Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions or Jenkins)

## How It Works
1. **Ingestion:** Uploads raw case files, PDFs, or forms via the web dashboard or API.  
2. **Extraction:** OCR and text preprocessing convert documents into structured text.  
3. **NLP Processing:** Applies classification, summarization, and entity extraction models.  
4. **Validation:** Checks for missing or incomplete fields and flags them automatically.  
5. **Summarization & Output:** Generates concise summaries and structured data outputs.  
6. **Review & Approval:** Reviewers can view flagged cases, summaries, and metadata in a secure dashboard.

## Use Cases
- **Case Management Automation:** Streamlines review of social service and legal case files.  
- **Application Processing:** Automates validation and summary generation for public forms.  
- **Policy Review:** Summarizes lengthy regulatory documents for policy analysts.  
- **Public Transparency:** Supports freedom-of-information processing with redacted summaries.

## Security & Compliance
PromiseAI is designed for high-security government and enterprise environments:
- **Encryption:** AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit.  
- **Access Control:** Role-based user permissions and multi-factor authentication.  
- **Audit Logging:** Tracks all document interactions for compliance.  
- **Compliance Standards:** Built in alignment with **FedRAMP**, **FISMA**, and **GDPR** frameworks.

## Future Roadmap
- Integration with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for contextual document understanding.  
- Real-time data redaction and classification of sensitive content.  
- Multi-language support for global use cases.  
- Integration with SharePoint, Alfresco, and other document management systems.  
- Reinforcement learning to continuously improve NLP accuracy from reviewer feedback.
